# Filename: max_grade.py
# Descr:    A simple program that outputs the single maximum value from an
#           input list (at the command line) of total points earned over an
#           academic term during a community college course. Rounds the output
#           value to a single decimal place. 
#           An exercise in completing an existing program, by writing the code
#           for a user-defined function implementing a well-known algorithm.
# 
#         
# Task:     Complete the body of the following function:
#           â€¢ get_maximum()
#           ...to make the program output the desired result.
# 
# Ex: If the total earned points were entered at the command line as:
#   python3 maxgrade.py 98.75 78.25 76 61.5 88 87.5
#   
#  the output would be:
#   Largest total course score was: 98.8
